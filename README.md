# Blog platform

Backend  service for a blog platform developed in Spring Boot.
he platform enables users to publish their own articles and share them with others.
Users can also comment on articles and like them.
Articles can be filtered by categories and authors.

The service utilizes stateless JWT authentication and authorization based on roles.

At the moment, the service is in development, 
with plans for additional features in the future. 
Currently, I am working on the frontend part of the platform in Angular 
to showcase the functionality of the service.
